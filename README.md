# Java Programs Repository â€” From Basics to Advanced

## Overview

This is my personal collection of Java programs that I've been working on regularly. It includes everything from basic concepts to more complex programs, all written in Java. I'm using this repository to keep track of my progress, improve my coding skills, and stay consistent with practice. Everything here is coded by me from scratch, with a focus on writing clean and understandable code.

## Goals

* Get better at **object-oriented programming** in Java.
* Practice solving **algorithmic problems** efficiently.
* Understand how to write **modular, reusable code**.
* Explore **Java libraries**, **Collections Framework**, and file handling.
* Learn **exception handling**, **multi-threading**, and working with files.
* Implement common **data structures** and try out **design patterns**.
